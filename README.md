In many neighborhoods, small businesses such as barbershops, hair salons, beauty spas, and nail studios provide essential services. However, customers often struggle to find and book appointments efficiently. Many of these businesses rely on walk-ins, phone calls, or social media for bookings, leading to:
Inconvenience for customers who have to visit multiple locations or call ahead to check availability.
Lost revenue for businesses due to inefficient scheduling and missed appointments.
Lack of visibility for local businesses, making it difficult for new customers to find them.
Problem Statement
There is no centralized booking platform that allows users to discover businesses on their street, view available services, and book appointments seamlessly. Small business owners also lack an easy-to-use system to manage bookings, reduce no-shows, and improve customer engagement.
Proposed Solution
We propose building a mobile application that:
1.Allows users to search for businesses on a specific street using Google Maps.
2.Automatically fetches business details (name, phone, services) from Google Places API.
3.Creates an online booking system for each business, enabling customers to book services instantly.
4.Provides business owners with a dashboard to manage bookings, set working hours, and send reminders.
5.Sends email/SMS notifications to confirm appointments and reduce no-shows.
Key Benefits
✅ Convenience: Users can quickly find and book services near them.
✅ Increased Visibility: Businesses get more exposure to new customers.
✅ Efficient Scheduling: Automated bookings reduce missed appointments.
✅ Improved Customer Engagement: Notifications and reminders enhance user experience.
